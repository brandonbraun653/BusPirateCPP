# BusPirateCPP
A humble C++ based driver for the BusPirate, created with the intention of plugging in to my [Chimera](https://github.com/brandonbraun653/chimera) HAL library. Originally developed for the purpose of testing out device driver software for various sensors, controllers, or anything that can talk with SPI/UART/I2C. Hopefully you find this useful!

Eventually the documentation for this will be updated as it progresses.
